submit-comment not working - need to bind GOT IT!



remove from what was there originally, the button class is second arg in on.('click'...)
NEED TO REMOVE THE LI's under it as well which may be another binding issue...





then need to make it work for all posts in groups - probably use data attribute


maybe reorg first with data attributes, then finish the removes


line 28: big div for posts - probably not necessary but OK

line 29: div id="post1"  		should add data attribute
- includes div id="comments"   		should have data attributes


- jquery adds div id="post1" INSIDE line 29 div id="post1"
- - this should be outside and have a new data attribute


The only thing missing is keeping the comment with the post, everything else is nicely dynamic

USE CLOSEST!!!

$(this).closest('div[comments-list-form]');
